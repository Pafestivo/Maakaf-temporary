## Getting started

### Fork the repository

### Clone the project

Clone your fork locally. Do not clone the original repository unless you plan to become a long-term contributor and have been given permission to do so.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/[your-github-user]/Maakaf-temporary.git
cd Maakaf-temporary
```

### Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies:

### Create a branch

Create and check out your feature branch:

```shell
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

### Make changes locally

### Commit your changes

```shell
git commit -m 'Add some feature'
```

### Push your changes

<!-- - Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. ?? check this..-->

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem in the codebase that you believe needs to be fixed, or you have an idea for a new feature, take a look at the [Issues](https://github.com/Maakaf/Maakaf-temporary/issues).

If you can't find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Maakaf/Maakaf-temporary/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` and `projects` to find issues that need attention.

Then, fork the repository (if this is your first contribution to this project. Otherwise, sync your fork), create a branch, and make your changes.

Finally, open a pull request with the changes.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations :tada::tada: The GitHub team thanks you :sparkles:.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [Maakaf-temporary](https://github.com/Maakaf/Maakaf-temporary).
